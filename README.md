# Developer notes

- I chose to use `@reduxjs/toolkit`` as its pretty much the new standard
- It's the first time I use `styled-components`, I guess my objects can probably be organized in a better way
- I used some libraries. This might be a bit overkill for such an small app, but I usually choose setup apps thinking on the long run
  - `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` for the modal,
  - `react-native-vector-icons` for the icons
  - `react-intl` to process the date
  - `zod` for data validation of the form (I usually combine it with `react-hook-form`)

# Mobile Coding Challenge

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) and has addtional libraries included:

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [polished](https://polished.js.org/)

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start:api`

```sh
yarn start:api
```

Starts the fake REST API server on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

#### Notes

- You can re-run the script to reset/regenerate the data.
